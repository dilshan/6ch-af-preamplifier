# 5.1 channel audio preamplifier

This project introduces a digitally controlled 5.1 channel audio preamplifier system. This amplifier is specifically designed to increase the gain of the multi-channel PC sound cards.

This preamplifier consists of six *[TL074](https://octopart.com/tl074idt-stmicroelectronics-410591)*/*[TL072](https://octopart.com/tl072idt-stmicroelectronics-410448)* preamplifier stages and *[PT2258](http://www.princeton.com.tw/Portals/0/Product/PT2258.pdf)* electronic volume control. The input stage of this preamplifier consists of six *TL074*/*TL072* buffer stages. The *[PIC16F886](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/product/PIC16F886)* microcontroller manages the *PT2258* electronic volume control IC. All the volume levels and menu options are displayed on [*HD44780*, 16×2 character LCD screen](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_9iRz4T).
